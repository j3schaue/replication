green1: hey i would think both are from kladinsky?
green4: hi
green4: why so?
green3: well, my opinion is 6- kandisky, 7- klee
green6: i think either 6 kandisky 7 klee or both kandisky
green3: (y)
green6: 'cause klee seldom uses yellow?
green4: yeah i agree that at least pic 6 should be kandinsky
green1: if you see pictures 1-5, kandinsky's paintings are usually more colourful
green1: while klee usually uses neutral colour
green6: yeah 
green2: i think 6-kadinsky 7-klee
green6: but the colour scheme in 4b looks quite similar to 7
green5: painting no. 7 uses the same technique as 1B, with the change of hue from red to yellow/green
green6: (y)(y)
green2: its not only color. can see the object also
green1: yup agree with 5, that's why i think 7 is also kadinsky
green6: ok i'm convinced both are from kadinsky haha
