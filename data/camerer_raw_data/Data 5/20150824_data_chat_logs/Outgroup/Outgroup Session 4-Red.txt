red3: :p
red1: ha ha
red5: lol
red3: kandisky uses abstract designs
red4: so 7 is klee?
red3: klee uses geometric
red3: usually
red1: how do you justify 1B then ??
red5: kandinsky uses geometric in 1B
red3: oh ya
red3: hence, usually
red2: yeap and i think 1B's style is rly the same as 7
red6: i think so too^
red5: hmm maybe we just choose 6 as kandinsky while 7 as klee?

red2: geometric and the darker colour gradually changing to lighter one
