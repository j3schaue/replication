green5: alrightttt so whats everyone's take on the 2 pics?

green2: 7 shd be kandisky
green2: I have that impression
green6: 7 should be kandinsky
green1: any reasons
green3: Coz thru out the pics Klee likes squares?
green6: cos the colours are brighter in a sense and there are geometric shapes as seen in 4A and 3B
