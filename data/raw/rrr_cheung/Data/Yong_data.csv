The first study required participants to answer qns about their relationships (like how would you feel if you break up & to think about a future with your partner) and the second study asked participants questions about situations that could possibly happen in a relationship. I think the first study primes us to think about the current state of our relationship so that we can recall similar incidents/situations as those mentioned in the second study. ,"Probably. I think the pilot study assumes that participants are in happy and committed relationships since the items within the study required us to give very positive answers about our relationship. When we're presented with averse situations in the second study (like your partner kissing or being sexually intimate with someone else) we're more likely to recall the ""positives"" of our relationship and feel more forgiving towards our partner I guess??","I'm not sure what writing prompts the other participants got but I think it's possible that other participants got writing prompts that got them to consider about the negative aspects of their relationships like maybe what's one thing they often fight about with their partner, or what characteristic of their partner annoys them the most.",1,1,1,RRR - Finkel - Li,1.293106079,103.8558044,-1,1
