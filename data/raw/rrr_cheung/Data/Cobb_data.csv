To get participant to process some information that they know about their partner.,To try and see how the participant view their relationship with their partner. Perhaps even infer on the personality or characteristics of the participant themselves.,A bit I think. The first study asked some more fundamental questions which would have influence based on the questions asked in the second study. E.g. #1 reason to grow old with partner. Based on what we thought over there could influence our answer regaring whether or not we want the relationship to be long term.,I think it did. It got me to think a bit about my partner and perhaps the more positive side of things. The pilot study I got seems to steer me towards a more positive outlook of my relationship therefore my answers might be more optimistic than they realy are.,"I can't say for sure, but that seems reasonable to see how certain questions or wording of questions regarding one's relationship can affect the outcome of the main study.
