I believe that the first study was a way to illicit positive feelings from the survey taker and then compare the two groups (the one with the positive sounding questions and the one with the negative or no study at all) to see if it changed their answers.,"It might have. If anything it made them a little bit more positive, but I am not sure. I don't think that it had THAT big of an effect on my answers other than getting me thinking about the long term with my partner. That being said, I wouldn't seek revenge and to 'get back' at my partner - whether I took the first survey or not.",I don't believe they did. I think one writing prompt was more negative - talking mostly about things relating to breakups and the like. ,1,1,1,Sucharyna University of Manitoba,49.81430054,-97.15309906,-1,2R_2rTTcOsyKqcJFjX,Default Response Set,Anonymous,,,130.179.244.116,0,15-09-29 11:05,15-09-29 12:02,1,M017,1,1,1,2,6,3,0,8,0,0,7,3,8,0,0,5,3,4,4,0,4,1,7,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,6,0,2,3,5,3,8,8,4,0,4,6,1,4,5,0,8,0,1,1,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,6,5,4,1,7,4,5,3,7,4,5,5,6,2,6,6,7,5,2,1,2,2,4,4,5,6,4,4,7,7,3,5,2,7,3,6,1,,19,2,,1,4,,3,10,1,22,1,1,1,Some answers to the hypothetical questions seemed strange; there were definitely other options that could have been put on there. ,To understand how people in relationships perceive how their relationships work and why they are in a relationship.,To understand how rational people are when making decisions during a relationship based on their personality.,"Yes, they both asked questions about your relationship.",No.,"If everyone did not receive the same prompts, I'm guessing they would have been the direct opposite of the ones on my paper.
