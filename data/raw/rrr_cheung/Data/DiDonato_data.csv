It wasn't strange so much as I smiled a little bit. I'm interested to see how consistent I am in regards to my perception of dating and my perception of answering questions that seemingly have a yes or no!,"Although the questions seemed to be about the other person, it was very self-oriented. I would assume the purpose is surrounding more of how people evaluate themselves rather than how they assume others love them.","I assume that the purpose of this main study was about how well we know ourselves when we fall in love. There is a reason why people say ""love is blind."" I would also say that the purpose of this study was to evaluate simply just, how do people judge character, themselves included.",Yes. They revolve around self-perception.,"Not really. I was honest with both. However, I enjoyed the pilot study more because I had a chance of explaining. For example, the main study asked if I thought my parents' punishments were fair. I had to answer with a number rather than saying that although I do believe my punishments were fair, they were fair according to my parents' beliefs and standards, rather than how I would punish myself. They are strongly Catholic and believe that the best punishment for having found out I skipped class to hang out with my significant other is to yell at me about purity and then make sure I don't go out on a Saturday night. Whereas if I were the parent, I would explain to my child the importance of classes and that, although relationships seem like they over-arch everything in a young adult's life, there are other responsibilities that trump relationships. And hey, you're going to see him/her on Saturday night, so this was more about irresponsibility rather than sex and pleasure and failure as a Catholic. Long answer short: the pilot study made me more critical of how I couldn't* answer during the main study. I hope this makes sense!","It depends on the purpose of the study. If it were to surrounding the idea of how different wording changes people's answers, then yes, the prompts would need to be different. I would probably answer differently if you asked me ""how do you love?"" versus ""what do you do to show the other person you love them?"" (The former I would explain my mental state; the latter I would explain my actions.) The interesting thing that the prompts might have differed would be, not only to change the subject of the question, but also, or instead, change a single word or phrase: 1. ""How do you feel about growing old with your partner?"" versus 2. ""How do you feel about spending the rest of your life with your partner?"" versus 3. ""How do you feel about aging with your partner?"" I, at least, would think differently for each, e.g. 1. think about how we will love one another and how our love will change because ""growing old"" has been romanticized (""The Notebook""). 2. think about the experiences we will have together 3. think about the physical aging process and how my significant other will think about my physical changes, like pregnancy scars, wrinkles, hair colour",1,1,1,DiDonato,39.35549927,-76.63549805,-1,0
