red6: Kandinsky's painting is always more colorful than Klee's
red2: i agree
red3: hello
red5: i think pic6 is very geometric, very kandinsky too
red3: yeap i agree too
red2: but what about the painting 5
red4: but color wise they dont really have much difference this time round
red3:  painting 6 might not be kandinsky's painting as his always sharper and neater compared to klee
red3: yea only can go tru the line
red3: klee's line always not that neat
red1: but i feel painting 6 is more like klee cause the lines tend to be quite obvious
red4: when kandinsky uses his geometry in his paintings. it's neat. but when he doesnt. it's just really colourful
red4: i agree
