red1: hi
red4: Hi, guys !
red6: hello!
red5: hello
red3: hi
red2: HI
red4: I feel like the painting 6 should be painted by the Kandi 
red6: not very good in art but based on my observation, i think Klee tends to employ colors which are less bright while Kandinsky tends to use more vivid colors
red4: Yes, I think so 
red2: I think  no. 6 is kandinsky
red6: not sure if there are other criteria
red4: I was referring to the no. 5A paintings 
red1: hmm you're right. but for the 5B Klee used brighter color
red4: I think the total 5 pairs of drawings represents the arts that was drawn from different periods of time of the artists. 
red2: maybe not just for color. can be pattern 
red1: yeah
red6: yea.
red1: drawing 7 is like 1B
red4: but the 5B tends to use mre circular shapes, suchas squares...
red4: sorry, not sqaure, rounds
red1: hmm
red1: any other criteria you all can think of?
red4: KL also uses more lively things to represent drawings 
red4: Klee
red2: we can also see how close the painters put each pattern together. 6 is very close, while 7 is not. there are many spaces left
red6: yea. more animate objects like birds, plants etc
red4: so do we choose one?
red3: but i think 7's painting style looks more like kandinsky's
red3: like the colouring is in patches
red6: both 6 and 7 can be drawn by the same artist right?
red4: not so sure... like styles are mix together
red1: confusing
red4: would it possible that the drawings are done by the same person?
red1: Kandinsky might paint number 6 also
red5: KA likes to overlap his shapes also
red1: based on 4A coloring
red6: yea i feel kandinsky might have painted both
red4: hmmm
red5: and painting number 7 looks like he overlaps the shapes
red6: can't be sure
red1: need to decide fast
red2: yes, maybe same person for two
red3: can be the same person?
red5: so both KA?
red6: that's my answer. haha. but i am not sure
