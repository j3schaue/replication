red2: any ideas?
red1: any thoughts?
red2: i think 6 is done by klee, because its very rectangular, like all his other paintings
red2: kandisky artworks seem to be more messy
red6: i d say 6 is by kandinsky 
red2: the others?
red1: i feel like 6 is klee too though
red1: Kanindsky seems either really messy, or really specific in his nuances
red3: i think 6 is done by kandinsky,because the color is clear, not mixed
red6: 4a is not messy 
red1: what about 2a and 3b, both are kanindsky but they're practically splashes of colours mixing all over
red4: imo 6 is done by kandinsky and 7 is done by klee
